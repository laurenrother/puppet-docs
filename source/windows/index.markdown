<span class="versionnote">This documentation applies to Puppet versions ≥ 2.7.6 and Puppet Enterprise ≥ 2.5. Earlier versions may behave differently.</span>

**Puppet runs on Microsoft Windows® and can manage Windows systems alongside \*nix systems.** These pages explain how to install and run Puppet on Windows, and describe how it differs from Puppet on *nix.

[Running][]
-----

### Puppet Subcommands and Services

Windows nodes can run the following Puppet subcommands:

* **Puppet agent,** to fetch configurations from a puppet master and apply them
    * The agent functions as a standard Windows service, and agent runs can also be triggered manually.
    * Windows nodes can connect to any *nix puppet master server running Puppet 2.7.6 or higher.
* **Puppet apply,** to apply configurations from local manifest files
* **Puppet resource,** to directly manipulate system resources
* **Puppet inspect,** to send audit reports for compliance purposes

Because the installer doesn't alter the system's PATH variable, you must choose *Start Command Prompt with Puppet* from the Start menu to run Puppet commands manually.

Windows nodes can't act as puppet masters or certificate authorities, and most of the ancillary Puppet subcommands aren't supported on Windows.

### Puppet's Environment on Windows

* Puppet runs as a 32-bit process.
* Puppet has to run with elevated privileges; on systems with UAC, it will request explicit elevation even when running as a member of the local Administrators group.
* Puppet's configuration and data are stored in `%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Application Data\PuppetLabs` on Windows 2003, and in `%PROGRAMDATA%\PuppetLabs` on Windows 7 and 2008.

### Resource Types

Some \*nix resource types aren't supported on Windows, and there are some Windows-only resource types.

The following resource types can be managed on Windows:

* [file](/references/latest/type.html#file)
* [user](/references/latest/type.html#user)
* [group](/references/latest/type.html#group)
* [scheduled_task](/references/latest/type.html#scheduledtask) (Windows-only)
* [package](/references/latest/type.html#package)
* [service](/references/latest/type.html#service)
* [exec](/references/latest/type.html#exec)
* [host](/references/latest/type.html#host)

[Troubleshooting][]
-----

The most common points of failure on Windows systems aren't the same as those on *nix. For full details, see [Troubleshooting Puppet on Windows][troubleshooting].

* * *

[For Developers and Testers][from_source]
-----

To test pre-release features, or to hack and improve Puppet on Windows, you can run Puppet from source. This requires a fairly specific version of Ruby and several important gems. For full details, see [Running Puppet from Source on Windows][from_source].
