Facter is Puppet's cross-platform system profiling library. It discovers and reports per-node facts, which are available in your Puppet manifests as variables.

* [The list of core facts](./core_facts.html) lists and describes every built-in fact that ships with Facter.
* [The custom fact reference](./fact_overview.html) serves as an example-driven primer and quick reference for fact authors.
* [The custom facts walkthrough](./custom_facts.html) explains in detail how to write and distribute your own custom or external facts.
* [The Facter release notes](./release_notes.html) document Facter's history.
