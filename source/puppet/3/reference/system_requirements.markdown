Basic Requirements
-----

Puppet 3 has the following prerequisites:

### Ruby

**All Puppet 3.x releases:**

- MRI Ruby 1.8.7 or Ruby 1.9.3; other interpreters and versions of Ruby are not supported, and may or may not work.

**Puppet 3.2.x and later:**

- As above, plus MRI Ruby 2.0.x.

### Facter

- [Facter](http://www.puppetlabs.com/puppet/related-projects/facter/) 1.6.2 or later

### Hiera

- [Hiera](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/hiera/latest/) 1.0 or later

### Optional: the `rgen` Ruby Gem (Puppet 3.2.0 and later)

If you are using Puppet â‰¥ 3.2 [with `parser = future` enabled](./lang_experimental_3_2.html), you will need:

- [rgen gem](http://ruby-gen.org/downloads) 0.6.1 or later
