Welcome to the Puppet 3.6 Reference Manual! Use the navigation to the left to get around.

## Previous Versions

- [Puppet 3.5](/puppet/3.5/reference)
- [Puppet 3.0 through 3.4](/puppet/3/reference)
- [Puppet 2.7](/puppet/2.7/reference)

## Getting Started

To install Puppet 3.6, see [the Puppet installation guide](/guides/install_puppet/pre_install.html). For general advice on upgrading between major versions, see [Upgrading Puppet](/guides/install_puppet/upgrading.html).

## Getting Around

This manual is split into several sections, which can be reached from the left sidebar. A few notable pages:

* [The Puppet 3.6 Release Notes](./release_notes.html) contain information about Puppet 3.6's new features, and tracks changes from patch releases.
* The [Resource Type Reference](/references/3.6.latest/type.html) is the page where experienced Puppet users spend most of their time.
* Puppet uses its own configuration language. The [Language Summary](./lang_summary.html) gives some context and acts as a starting point for the language reference.
* The [Visual Index to the Puppet Language](./lang_visual_index.html) can help you find the reference for a piece of syntax when you know what it looks like but don't know what it's called.
* ["Modules"](./modules_fundamentals.html) explains how to organize your Puppet manifests, obtain pre-existing modules, and publish your own modules for public use.
