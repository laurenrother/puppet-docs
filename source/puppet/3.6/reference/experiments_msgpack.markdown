title: "Experimental Features: Msgpack Support"
canonical: "/puppet/latest/reference/experiments_msgpack.html"

> **Warning:** This document describes an **experimental feature,** which is not officially supported and is not considered ready for production. [See here for more information about experimental features in Puppet](./experiments_overview.html), especially if you are using Puppet Enterprise.

> **Status:** We think Msgpack is probably superior to our existing serialization formats, but we aren't sure yet and haven't tested all edge cases. If it proves to do well under real-world loads, we may eventually adopt it as our default wire format.

Background on Msgpack
-----

Puppet agents and masters communicate over HTTPS, exchanging structured data in some serialization format. Traditionally, this has been a mix of YAML and JSON (or actually "PSON," which allows binary data); more recently, we've been trying to deprecate YAML and move entirely to PSON.

[Msgpack](http://msgpack.org/) is an efficient (in space and time) serialization protocol that behaves similarly to JSON. It should provide faster and more robust serialization for agent/master communications, without requiring many changes in our code.

When msgpack is enabled, the puppet master and agent will communicate using msgpack instead of PSON or YAML.


Enabling Msgpack Serialization
-----

Enabling msgpack is easy, but enabling it requires a change on both the master and all agent nodes.

1. Install the [msgpack gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/msgpack) on your master and all agent nodes.
    * If you are using a Puppet Enterprise test environment, be sure to use PE's gem command instead of the system gem command. On \*nix nodes, use `/opt/puppet/bin/gem install msgpack`. On Windows 32-bit systems, use `"C:\Program Files\Puppet Labs\Puppet\sys\ruby\bin\gem" install msgpack`; on 64-bit systems, substitute `Program Files (x86)` for `Program Files`.
2. On any number of agent nodes, set [the `preferred_serialization_format` setting](/references/3.6.latest/configuration.html#preferredserializationformat) to `msgpack` (in the `[agent]` or `[main]` section of puppet.conf).

Once this is configured, the puppet master server(s) will use msgpack when serving any agents that have `preferred_serialization_format` set to `msgpack`. Any agents without that setting will continue to receive PSON as normal.
