When using [directory environments][], each environment may contain an `environment.conf` file. This file can override several settings whenever the puppet master is serving nodes assigned to that environment.

## Location

Each environment.conf file should be stored in a [directory environment][directory environments]. It should be at the top level of its home environment, next to the `manifests` and `modules` directories.

For example: if your [`environmentpath` setting][environmentpath] is set to `$confdir/environments`, the environment.conf file for the `test` environment should be located at `$confdir/environments/test/environment.conf`.

## Example

    # /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/test/environment.conf
    # Exclude global directories in basemodulepath from this environment:
    modulepath = modules
    # Use our custom script to get a git commit for the current state of the code:
    config_version = get_environment_commit.sh

## Format

The environment.conf file uses the same INI-like format as puppet.conf, with one exception: it cannot contain config sections like `[main]`. All settings in environment.conf must be outside any config section.

### Allowed Settings

In this version of Puppet, the environment.conf file is only allowed to override four settings:

* [`modulepath`][modulepath]
* [`manifest`][manifest]
* [`config_version`][config_version]
* [`environment_timeout`][environment_timeout]

### Relative Paths in Values

Most of the allowed settings accept file paths or lists of paths as their values.

If any of these paths are **relative paths** --- that is, they start _without_ a leading slash or drive letter --- they will be resolved relative to that environment's main directory.

#### Relative Path Examples

The example environment.conf file above configures an environment called `test`, which is located in `$confdir/environments`. This means:

* The `modulepath = modules` line will resolve to `modulepath = /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/test/modules`. This removes all of the global directories inherited from the `basemodulepath` setting, and limits the environment to only its local modules.
* Likewise, `config_version = get_environment_commit.sh` in that environment will be interpreted as `config_version = /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/test/get_environment_commit.sh`

### Interpolation and `$environment`

Settings in environment.conf can use the special `$environment` variable in their values. Puppet will replace `$environment` with the name of the active environment.

This is almost never necessary for `modulepath` or `manifest`, but it can be useful as an argument to your `config_version` script.

Settings in environment.conf can also interpolate other settings as variables, such as `$confdir`.
