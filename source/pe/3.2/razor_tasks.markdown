Tasks describe a process or collection of actions that should be performed while provisioning machines. They can be used to designate an operating system or other software that should be installed, where to get it, and the configuration details for the installation.

Tasks are structurally basic: they consist of a YAML metadata file and any number of templates. Once you've automated the install for your operating system (for example, via kickstart or preseed), turning that into a task is a matter of writing a bit of metadata and templating some of the things that your task does. For examples, check out the [stock tasks](https://github.com/puppetlabs/razor-server/tree/master/tasks) that ship with Razor.

Tasks are stored in the file system. The configuration setting `task_path` determines where in the file system Razor looks for tasks and can be a colon-separated list of paths. Relative paths in that list are taken to be relative to the top-level Razor directory. For example, setting `task_path` to `/opt/puppet/share/razor-server/tasks:/home/me/task:tasks` will make Razor search these three directories in that order for tasks.

## Task Metadata

Tasks can include the following metadata in the task's YAML file. This file is called  `NAME.yaml` where `NAME` is the task name.

    ---
    description: HUMAN READABLE DESCRIPTION
    os: OS NAME
    os_version: OS_VERSION_NUMBER
    base: TASK_NAME
    boot_sequence:
      1: boot_templ1
      2: boot_templ2
      default: boot_local

Only `os_version` and `boot_sequence` are required. The `base` key allows you to derive one task from another by reusing some of the `base` metadata and templates. If the derived task has metadata that's different from the metadata in `base`, the derived metadata overrides the base task's metadata.

The `boot_sequence` hash indicates which templates to use when a node using this task boots. In the example above, a node will first boot using `boot_templ1`, then using `boot_templ2`. For every subsequent boot, the node will use `boot_local`.

## Writing Templates

Task templates are ERB templates and are searched in all the directories given in the `task_path` configuration setting. Templates are searched in the subdirectories in this order: 

1. `name/os_version`
2. `name`
3. `common` 

If the task has a base task, the base task's template directories are searched just before the `common` directory.

####Template Helpers
Templates can use the following helpers to generate URLs that point back to the server; all of the URLs respond to a `GET` request, even the ones that make changes on the server:

* `file_url(TEMPLATE)`: the URL that will retrieve `TEMPLATE.erb` (after evaluation) from the current node's task.
* `repo_url(PATH)`: the URL to the file at `PATH` in the current repo.
* `log_url(MESSAGE, SEVERITY)`: the URL that will log `MESSAGE` in the current node's log.
* `node_url`: the URL for the current node.
* `store_url(VARS)`: the URL that will store the values in the hash `VARS` in the node. Currently only changing the node's IP address is supported. Use `store_url("ip" => "192.168.0.1")` for that.
* `stage_done_url`: the URL that tells the server that this stage of the boot sequence is finished, and that the next boot sequence should begin upon reboot.
* `broker_install_url`: a URL from which the install script for the node's broker can be retrieved. You can see an example in the script, [os_complete.erb](https://github.com/puppetlabs/razor-server/blob/master/tasks/common/os_complete.erb), which is used by most tasks.

Each boot (except for the default boot) must culminate in something akin to `curl <%= stage_done_url %>` before the node reboots. Omitting this will cause the node to reboot with the same boot template over and over again.

The task must indicate to the Razor server that it has successfully completed by doing a `GET` request against `stage_done_url("finished")`, for example using `curl` or `wget`. This will mark the node `installed` in the Razor database.

You use these helpers by causing your script to perform an
`HTTP GET` against the generated URL. This might mean that you pass an
argument like `ks=<%= file_url("kickstart")%>` when booting a kernel, or
that you put `curl <%= log_url("Things work great") %>` in a shell script.
