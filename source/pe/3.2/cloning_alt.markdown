The live management cloning tool has been removed as of PE 3.0. We are continuing to improve resource inspection and interactive orchestration commands in the console.

In general, we recommend managing resources with Puppet manifests instead of one-off commands. This page describes an alternate workflow which can provide the same funtionality as the cloning tool did.

##### Alternate Workflow in Brief
Use `puppet resource` or [the puppetral plugin's `find` action](./orchestration_actions.html#find) to learn the details of resources on individual host. Then, use that information to write or append to a manifest.
