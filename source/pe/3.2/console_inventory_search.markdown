The **Inventory Search** section of the Puppet Enterprise console lets you search Puppet's inventory of node data. This search utility uses Puppet Enterprise's central data storage layer, PuppetDB.

## Using the Inventory Search

Use console's main navigation to reach the __Inventory Search__ section.

![The inventory search page][inventory_zoom]

This field allows you to enter a **fact name,** a **value,** and a **comparison operator.** After you have searched for one fact, you may narrow down the search by adding additional facts.

![Results of a search][inventory_search]

The search results page will show a list of nodes, as well as a summary of their recent Puppet runs. You can click nodes in the list to browse to their detail pages.

To choose facts to search for, you should [view the inventory data][inventory] for a node that resembles the nodes you are searching for.
