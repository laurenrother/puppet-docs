When nodes fetch their configurations from the puppet master, they send back inventory data and a report of their run. These end up in the console, where you can view them in that node's detail page.

Node States
-----

Depending on how its last Puppet run went, every node is in one of six states. Each state is indicated by a specific color in graphs and the [node state summary](./console_navigating.html#the-sidebar), and by an icon beside the report or the node name in a report list or node list view.

- <span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana; color: #818285;">Unresponsive:</span> The node hasn't reported to the puppet master recently; something may be wrong. The cutoff for considering a node unresponsive defaults to one hour, and can be configured in `settings.yml` with the `no_longer_reporting_cutoff` setting. Represented by dark grey text. This state has no icon; the node retains whatever icon the last report used.
- <span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana; color: #D93129;">Failed:</span> During its last Puppet run, this node encountered some error from which it couldn't recover. Something is probably wrong, and investigation is recommended. Represented by red text or the ![failed][failed] failed icon.
- <span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana; color: #EFA92D;">No-op:</span> During its last Puppet run, this node _would_ have made changes, but since it was either running in no-op mode or found a discrepancy in a resource whose `noop` metaparameter was set to `true`, it _simulated_ the changes instead of enforcing them. See the node's last report for more details. Represented by orange text or the ![pending][pending] pending icon.
- <span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana; color: #78B7D2;">Changed:</span> This node's last Puppet run was successful, and changes were made to bring the node into compliance. Represented by blue text or the ![changed][changed] changed icon.
- <span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana; color: #78C145;">Unchanged:</span> This node's last Puppet run was successful, and it was fully compliant; no changes were necessary. Represented by green text or the ![unchanged][unchanged] unchanged icon.
- <span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana; color: #818285;">Unreported:</span> Although Dashboard is aware of this node's existence, it has never submitted a Puppet report. It may be a newly-commissioned node, it may have never come online, or its copy of Puppet may not be configured correctly. Represented by light grey text or the ![error][error] error icon.

Reading Reports
-----

### Graphs

Each **node detail page** has a pair of graphs: a histogram showing the number of runs per day and the results of those runs, and a line chart tracking how long each run took. (Run status histograms also appear on class detail pages, group detail pages, and last-run-status pages.)

![The pair of graphs on a node page][reports_graphs]

The daily run status histogram is broken down with the same colors that indicate run status in the console's sidebar: red for failed runs, orange for pending runs (where a change would have been made, but the resource to be changed was marked as no-op), blue for successful runs where changes were made, and green for successful runs that did nothing.

The run-time chart graphs how long each of the last 30 Puppet runs took to complete. A longer run usually means changes were made, but could also indicate heavy server load or some other circumstance.

### Reports

Each node page has a short list of recent reports, with a __More__ button at the bottom for viewing older reports:

![The list of recent reports][reports_recent]

Each report represents a single Puppet run. Clicking a report will take you to a tabbed view that splits the report up into **metrics, log,** and **events.**

**Metrics** is a rough summary of what happened during the run, with resource totals and the time spent retrieving the configuration and acting on each resource type.

![The metrics tab of a report][reports_metricstab]

**Log** is a table of all the messages logged during the run.

![The log tab of a report][reports_logtab]

**Events** is a list of the resources the run managed, sorted by whether any changes were made. You can click on a changed resource to see which attributes were modified.

![The events tab of a report][reports_eventstab]


Viewing Inventory Data
-----

Each node's page has a section called inventory. This section contains all of the fact values reported by the node on its most recent run.

![The location of the inventory section][reports_inventory_location]

![Facts in the inventory][reports_inventory]

Facts include things like the operating system (`operatingsystem`), the amount of memory (`memorytotal`), and the primary IP address (`ipaddress`). You can also [add arbitrary custom facts][customfacts] to your Puppet modules, and they too will show up in the inventory.

[customfacts]: /guides/custom_facts.html

The facts you see in the inventory can be useful when [filtering nodes in the live management page](./console_navigating_live_mgmt.html#advanced-search).
