Puppet loads most of its settings from [the puppet.conf config file.][puppet.conf] You can edit this file directly, or you can change individual settings with the `puppet config set` command.

> When to Use This
> -----
>
> We recommend using `puppet config set` for:
>
> * Fast one-off config changes
> * Scriptable config changes in provisioning tools
>
> If you find yourself changing many settings at once, you might prefer to edit the puppet.conf file or manage it with a template.

Usage
-----

To assign a new value to a setting, run:

    $ sudo puppet config set <SETTING NAME> <VALUE> --section <CONFIG SECTION>

This will declaratively set the value of `<SETTING NAME>` to `<VALUE>` (in the specified config section). It will work the same way regardless of whether the setting already had a value.

### Config Sections

The `--section` option specifies which [section of puppet.conf][config_sections] to modify. **It defaults to `main`.** Valid sections are:

* `main` (used by all commands and services)
* `master` (used by the puppet master service and the `puppet cert` command)
* `agent` (used by the puppet agent service)
* `user` (used by the puppet apply command and most other commands)
* Any valid [environment][environments] name (used by all commands and services when requesting or compiling catalogs in that environment)

If modifying the [system config file][confdir_sys], be sure to use `sudo` or run the command as `root` or `Administrator`.

Example
-----

**Before:**

    # /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf
    [main]
    certname = agent01.example.com
    server = master.example.com
    vardir = /var/opt/lib/pe-puppet

    [agent]
    report = true
    graph = true
    pluginsync = true

    [master]
    dns_alt_names = master,master.example.com,puppet,puppet.example.com

**Commands:**

    $ sudo puppet config set trusted_node_data true --section master
    $ sudo puppet config set ordering manifest

**After:**

    # /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf
    [main]
    certname = agent01.example.com
    server = master.example.com
    vardir = /var/opt/lib/pe-puppet
    ordering = manifest

    [agent]
    report = true
    graph = true
    pluginsync = true

    [master]
    dns_alt_names = master,master.example.com,puppet,puppet.example.com
    trusted_node_data = true


Compatibility Note
-----

The `puppet config set` command first appeared in Puppet Enterprise 3.2. It can't be used with earlier versions of Puppet.
