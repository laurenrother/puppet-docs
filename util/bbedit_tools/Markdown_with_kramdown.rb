# This file should go in the ~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Preview Filters
# directory. It will allow you to render Markdown files with the Kramdown filter
# in preview windows -- just use the drop-down at the top of the window.

# You may need to run `sudo gem install kramdown` before this will work.

# Note that kramdown has to be installed in the SYSTEM gem path, not the rbenv
# one! Rbenv works great in the terminal, but not in GUI apps that don't source
# your bash profile before trying to execute scripts (e.g. bbedit).
#
# There are two ways to do this: either do `sudo /usr/bin/gem install kramdown`
# directly, or change rbenv back to "system" temporarily and then install
# kramdown.
#
# Actually there's a third way, as well: You can edit /etc/launchd.conf and add a line like:
# `setenv GEM_PATH <first rbenv gem path>:<second rbenv gem path>:<system gem path>`
# ...and then restart your computer. This will let your GUI apps load gems from
# rbenv. DON'T ACTUALLY DO THIS, though. You'll forget you set environment
# variables in that file, and then they'll eventually fall out of date and break
# something else, and you'll be pulling your hair out trying to figure out where
# these ghost variables are coming from.
